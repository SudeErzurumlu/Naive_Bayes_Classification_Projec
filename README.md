# Naive Bayes Classification Project

This project implements the **Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm** in multiple programming languages. The Naive Bayes Classifier is widely used for classification problems in machine learning, especially for tasks involving text analysis and spam detection. It works by applying Bayes' theorem with a strong assumption that all features are independent.

## Overview
- **Mathematical Scope**: Statistics, Probability Theory
- **Description**: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm for classification tasks. It calculates the probability of each class based on input features and assigns the label with the highest probability to the input. This implementation supports multiple languages to provide a flexible approach to Naive Bayes classification.
- **Difficulty Level**: Intermediate

## Implementation Languages
- **Python**
- **R**
- **Julia**
- **Scala**
- **Go**

Each implementation is designed to be modular, reusable, and easy to integrate into larger projects.

## Usage

Each file contains an example usage at the end to demonstrate how to train and make predictions using the Naive Bayes Classifier. Replace the example data with your own as needed.

### Example Usage (Python)

To run the classifier in Python:

```python
# Inside naive_bayes_classifier.py

X = [[1, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1], [0, 0]]
y = ["Spam", "Spam", "Ham", "Ham"]

classifier = NaiveBayesClassifier()
classifier.fit(X, y)
print("Predictions:", classifier.predict(X))
```

Run in terminal:

```bash
python naive_bayes_classifier.py
```

## Theory: Naive Bayes Classifier

The Naive Bayes algorithm calculates the probability of each class given a set of input features. The classifier then chooses the class with the highest probability for each prediction. This approach assumes that all features are conditionally independent given the class, making it "naive" but highly efficient and often effective.

### Formula

The probability that a given instance belongs to a class `C` is calculated as:

\[ P(C|X) = P(C) \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i|C) \]

where:
- \( P(C) \): Prior probability of the class
- \( P(X_i|C) \): Conditional probability of feature \( X_i \) given the class
